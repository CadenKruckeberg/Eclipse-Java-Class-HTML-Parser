# Eclipse Java Class HTML Parser

## Overview:
This is a small, personal project designed to create a `.java` file (Java source code text file) from a `.html` documentation file created by Eclipse IDE. This is particularly useful for students in UWâ€“Madison's CS 300 course, where students are provided documentation for Java code they are expected to create but not given a starting `.java` file, leading to wasted time copying and pasting Javadocs and signatures. This tool does not write any functional code by interpreting the Javadocs; it simply creates Java code with default return statements where necessary.

## How to Use:
1. Install Python.

2. Clone this repository.

3. Download the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. This project is a CLI tool with only one positional argument: `file`. Simply pass the directory to the `.html` documentation file you wish to convert to Java code. The `.java` file will be written to the same directory as `main.py` with the file name of `<ClassName>.java`, where ClassName is the name of the class the documentation file was created for. For example, running `python3 main.py MyObject.html` will create a `MyObject.java` in the same directory as `main.py`.

5. Move the created file to its intended location and implement the functionality of the code.

## Note:
This tool has not been extensively tested because it was made for personal use, but I did leave some documentation in case anyone wants to work with the code.
